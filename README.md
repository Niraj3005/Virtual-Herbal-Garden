Virtual Herbal Garden

The Virtual Herbal Garden is an interactive and immersive platform designed to educate users about the diverse medicinal plants used in AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).
Built with J2EE Spring Boot for the backend, React JS for the frontend, and MySQL as the database, the platform offers a seamless and efficient user experience. Users can explore various herbal plants, learn about their medicinal properties, and understand their applications in traditional healing.
This initiative bridges the gap between ancient wisdom and modern technology, promoting awareness of natural remedies while serving as a valuable resource for students, researchers, healthcare practitioners, and nature enthusiasts.
